# Arabic Trivia Questions Scraper

This Python script allows you to scrape Arabic trivia questions from a specific blog post using Selenium with an undetected ChromeDriver. The script goes to a blog post and extracts the questions and answers, then saves them in a JSON file for further use.

## Prerequisites

    Before running this script, you need to install the required Python packages. You can do this using the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install undetected-chromedriver selenium
    ```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Modify the script with your desired parameters:

   - `start` and `end`: Define the range of child elements you want to scrape within the specified CSS selector.
   - `selector`: Update the CSS selector to match the structure of the blog post you are scraping.
   - `driver.get()`: Replace the URL with the URL of the blog post you want to scrape.

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python trivia_scraper.py
    ```

    The script will launch an undetected Chrome browser, navigate to the blog post, scrape the questions and answers, and save them in a file named `data.json`.
